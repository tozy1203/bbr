One-key script
Thanks to @phuslu for his one-key script

Usage：

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tozy1203/rinetd-bbr/master/get-rinetd.sh | bash

The configuration file generated by one-key script is /etc/rinetd-bbr.conf. By default, it only proxy(speed up) port 443and80, modify the port number as needed.

Determine if function
Use top command， view process rinetd's CPU usage. The faster of network speed, the bigger of CPU usage.

Caution：
Dependency: iptables, grep, cut, xargs. Usual linux have these tools，But some linux use firewalld instead of iptables, it need install iptables
For KVM VPS, need to change venet0:0 to the name of the network interface which have KVM's public IP, normally it is eth0
